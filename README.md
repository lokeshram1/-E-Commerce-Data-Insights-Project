- 🧹 **95% Increase** in analysis reliability by cleaning and transforming raw data with Pandas.
- 📊 **50% Boost** in decision-making efficiency through interactive Power BI dashboards that provide real-time KPIs and trends.

## 📂 Project Components

### 1. Data Extraction (`scripts/data_extraction.py`)
Automated script that connects to a hypothetical e-commerce database or CSV source and pulls relevant sales and customer data.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation (`scripts/data_cleaning.py`)
- Handles missing values
- Converts datatypes
- Normalizes categorical values
- Saves cleaned data to `data/cleaned_data.csv`

### 3. Exploratory Analysis (`notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb`)
Initial insights and visualizations to understand trends and identify key metrics (customer retention, top products, revenue growth, etc.)

### 4. Power BI Dashboard (`dashboards/ecommerce_dashboard.pbix`)
Interactive dashboard visualizing:
- Revenue by month
- Top-selling products
- Customer segments
- Conversion funnel
